Personal blogging theme, free of clutter, with a focus on the writers words while not sacrificing visual quality.

## Description

Clean Blog is a WordPress theme with no sidebar, no excess clutter, easy to read content and a bold featured image to instantly grab your readers attention.

The beauty is in it's mininmalism. No exhaustive set of features to customize before being able to write.

It works immediately on upload. Yet, I did want to give some options in the Customizer that would allow you to make the theme uniquely your own.

**Recommended:** Download and use the [Clean Blog child theme](https://github.com/deviodigital/cleanblog-child) when customizing your website, so you can keep the main *Clean Blog* theme up-to-date without overriding your edits.

## Live Demo &amp; Release Notes
